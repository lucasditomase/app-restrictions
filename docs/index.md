# A Threat Analysis of Sideloading

## Key Insights

- iPhone's strong privacy/security is critical due to the sensitive nature of personal data stored on it.
- Sideloading (installing apps outside the App Store) poses major threats to this security model.
- Malware is far more prevalent on platforms that support sideloading (e.g., Android has 15–47x more infections than iOS).
- App Store review processes and system protections significantly reduce malware risk.

## Risks of Sideloading

- **Increased Malware**: Sideloading bypasses App Store checks, enabling adware, spyware, trojans, etc.
- **Social Engineering**: Users may be tricked into installing fake apps mimicking legitimate ones.
- **Reduced User Control**: Sideloaded apps may bypass parental controls, App Tracking Transparency, or permission prompts.
- **Weakened Platform Security**: Could require exposing proprietary APIs or OS internals, threatening iOS's core security architecture.
- **Negative Externalities**: Even users who avoid sideloading are at risk—e.g., via enterprise coercion, fake app store mimicry, or business/work needs.

## Malware Examples

- **Adware** (HiddenAds, CopyCat): Floods users with aggressive or fraudulent ads.
- **Ransomware** (CryCryptor, MalLocker.B): Encrypts device data and demands ransom.
- **Spyware** (SpyNote, HelloSpy): Monitors activity, captures private data, used in intimate partner surveillance.
- **Banking Trojans** (BlackRock, Anubis): Steals credentials via overlay attacks, even bypasses 2FA.

## Security Expert Advice

> "Only install apps from official app stores." — Europol
> "Avoid sideloading on BYOD devices." — US Dept. of Homeland Security
> "Third-party apps pose a serious security threat." — Interpol/Kaspersky

## Apple’s Position

- Apple already allows limited enterprise sideloading with strict controls.
- Prior misuse (e.g., Facebook Research app, Goontact spyware) shows how quickly these mechanisms are abused.
- Broad sideloading would magnify this risk drastically.

## Conclusion

Sideloading introduces widespread risks across users, developers, and organizations. Apple asserts that it would degrade platform trust, increase attack surfaces, and diminish privacy protections for all users—not just those who sideload.
